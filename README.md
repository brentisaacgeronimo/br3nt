*"WE DONâ€™T ASK FOR LIFE. WE HAVE IT THRUST UPON US."*
Directed by Tony Richardson, this story centers around a working class girl who struggles to create a life for herself with her gay co-worker after becoming pregnant from a one-night stand with a black sailor. Rita Tushingham, known for her works in The Knack ...and How to Get It, The Bed Sitting Room and most recently Last Night in Soho, and Murray Melvin, known for his works in Sparrows Can't Sing and Barry Landon, star in this beloved classic. This film embarks on the spotlight for gritty lower class people and shines on their problems. Every shot is remarkable and this film transports you to a world of realism. Very appropriate for today's world.
