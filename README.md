*"We don't ask for life. We have it thrust upon us."*
>
Directed by Tony Richardson, this story centers around a working class girl who struggles to create a life for herself with her gay co-worker after becoming pregnant from a one-night stand with a black sailor. Rita Tushingham, known for her works in The Knack ...and How to Get It, The Bed Sitting Room and most recently Last Night in Soho, and Murray Melvin, known for his works in Sparrows Can't Sing and Barry Landon, star in this beloved classic. This film embarks on the spotlight for gritty lower class people and shines on their problems. Every shot is remarkable and this film transports you to a world of realism. Very appropriate for today's world.

*"Why am I me and why not you? Why am I here and why not there? When did the time begin and when does space end?"*
>

A romantic fantasy film directed by Wim Wenders about invisible, immortal angels who populate Berlin and listen to the thoughts of its human inhabitants, comforting the distressed. Even though the city is densely populated, many of the people are isolated or estranged from their loved ones. One of the angels, played by Bruno Ganz, falls in love with a beautiful, lonely trapeze artist, played by Solveig Dommartin. The angel chooses to become mortal so that he can experience human sensory pleasures, ranging from enjoying food to touching a loved one, and so that he can discover human love with the trapeze artist. This film provides the viewers with a very powerful theme that embraces life beyond humanity and touches each viewers with an ounce of hope to a second life. Beautifully shot and a great follow-up from Wenders' previous film, Paris, Texas.

*"Well, everyone knows Custer died at Little Bighorn. What this book presupposes is... maybe he didn't."*
>

A Wes Anderson classic follows the lives of three gifted siblings who experience great success in youth, and even greater disappointment and failure in adulthood. The children's eccentric father Royal Tenenbaum, played by Gene Hackman, leaves them in their adolescent years, then returns to them after they have grown, falsely claiming he has a terminal illness as he works on reconciling with his children and ex-wife. The film is astounding. Stunning shots, wonderful acting with a stellar script. The style of Wes Anderson never lets the viewers down as he provides each scene with a purpose. Gritting and jaw-breaking. Wes Anderson proves to be a modern day auteur.

*"I have so much to do. I think I’ll probably read Proust … Because sometimes it’s good to do what you’re supposed to do when you’re supposed to do it."*


Written and directed by Noah Baumbach, who also directed Marriage Story and Mistress America, Frances Ha tells the story of an aspiring dancer moves to New York City and becomes caught up in a whirlwind of flighty fair-weather friends, diminishing fortunes and career setbacks. Greta Gerwig who co-wrote and stars in the film embarked the screen with fiery and relatable emotions as she steps into the shoes of a dreamer. Viewers can connnect with this film in a personal way as the cinematography and screenplay are remarkable. Aesthetically pleasing as every scene displays stunning shots of the landmarks. The black-and-white theme just goes along well with the story and is set to give the audience eighty-six minutes of well-used time.
